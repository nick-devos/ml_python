# This is a new version of the machine learning program that we have been working with. Instead of music predictions, this program uses loan data to determine whether or not a borrower will default on their loan based on the interest rate and their FICO credit score. There are much more rows of data in the CSV but still only using 3 columns of data. Try changing the interest rate and credit score and see the prediction change (output of 0 means loan will be paid in full, 1 means borrower won't fully pay back).
